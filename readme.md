# Learn random forests in R & databricks community

## Executive summary

Random forests are a machine learning approach that addesses the shortcomings
of decision trees. According to 2007 [research] random forests were in top-10
most popular machine learning algorithms. Random forests improve performance
by averaging multiple decision trees. The algorithm has **2** features that
help improve the performance.

**Bagging** is the first feature. Random forest generates a prediction based
on the average prediction of many decision trees. This approach works if the
trees are randomly different.

**Randomizing variables** that build a tree is the second feature. Randomly
choosing the variables reduces the correlation between the trees in the
forest.

One possible drawback when a researcher uses *random forests* could be a loss
in interpretation of the variables. The is a walkaround for this known issue.
Random forests difine variable importance by counting how often a variable is
used in the individual trees.

The purpose of this project is to learn how to use random forests in multiple
and binary classification models. The project consists of two parts. In the 
first part, we look at model tuning parameters and different approaches to 
model tuning. In the second part, we make a data product that classifies the
cars. 

**TODO: decide, which dataset to use for data product**
